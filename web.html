The shooter claimed to be with ISIL, however the FBI and the CIA conducted an investigation and found no evidence that linked ISIL and the shooter. 49 people were killed and 53 others were wounded. It was the deadliest mass shooting by a single shooter, the deadliest incident of violence against LGBT people and the deadliest terroriest attack in the U.S. since 9/11. </p>'+
